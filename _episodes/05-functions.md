title: "Parsing Data with Functions"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I execute the same code on different data?"
objectives:
- "Write functions to accomplish repeatable tasks"
- "Use the functions in a library to handle tricky tasks like parsing call numbers"
- "Utilize loops to apply functions to rows of data"
keypoints:
- "Write functions to efficiently run code you want to reuse."
- "Functions can make use of other functions - those you import from libraries, as well as those you write yourself."
- "Well written and tested functions can reliably do things that might be hard to accomplish by hand."
