title: "Aggregation & Re-identification"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "If de-identified data can be re-identified, and anonymization is hard to guarantee, how can we protect our patrons' privacy?"
objectives:
- "Summarize and aggregate data about individual patrons into data about the population"
- "Evaluate the risk of re-identification by looking at the size of the smallest sub-populations described"
keypoints:
- "Data aggregation is the process of combining data in such a way that it no longer refers to specific individuals, but rather reveals insight about groups within the population."
- "Data which is both de-identified and aggregated can still be valuable for analysis while posing less risk to the privacy of our patrons."
