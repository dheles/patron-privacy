title: "PII and Other Risky Data"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What data could pose a risk to our patrons' privacy?"
- "Where might risky data be found?"
- "What are some things we can do to limit these risks?"
objectives:
- "Define PII"
- "Distinguish between the two types of PII"
- "List examples of PII that might be found in library data"
- "Explain how data becomes riskier when combined"
- "Offer some strategies that might limit these risks, while still providing valuable insights"
keypoints:
- "Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is of two types."
- "In a library context, PII 1 is information about a patron. (E.g. name, date of birth, library barcode, etc.)"
- "PII 2 is information about your activities and other information that can be linked back to a patron. (E.g. search history, circulation records, access to electronic resources, etc.)"
- "By making connections within a pool of data, it is possible to identify specific patrons and their activities"
- "Limiting the data we collect and how long we keep it around can help mitigate these risks"
