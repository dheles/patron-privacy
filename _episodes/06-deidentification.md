title: "De-identification"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I remove PII from library data?"
objectives:
- "Distinguish between de-identification & anonymization"
- "Use a combination of approaches to de-identify data"
keypoints:
- "De-identification is the process of removing or obscuring PII, such that the remaining information does not identify an individual."
- "De-identified information can be re-identified, given access to the right information (e.g. the algorithm or pseudonym used for de-identification or sufficient data from other sources about the patrons in the original data)."
- "Anonymization is the process of de-identifying information in such a way that it cannot be re-identified, usually by means of statistical disclosure limitation techniques."
- "Due to continuous advances in computation technology, full anonymity is difficult (some would say impossible) to guarantee."
